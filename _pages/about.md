![nature-7175030_1920](./images/nature-7175030_1920.png)
I am a dedicated Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Science at The University of Manchester, with a strong interest in data science and urban studies. My expertise lies in urban climate modeling, sustainable urban environments, and informed urban planning. My Ph.D. work centers on using data-driven approaches to address urban climate challenges, including capturing the dynamic interactions between urban and the atmosphere, and advancing models of urban surface features.
